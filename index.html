        <h1 id="about">Leonardo_DiCaprio</h1>
        <p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio (born November 11, 1974) is an American actor, film producer and environmentalist. He has often played unconventional roles, particularly in biopics and period films. As of 2019, his films have grossed $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has placed eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors.

        Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s, he played recurring roles in various television series, such as the sitcom Parenthood.<br><br> DiCaprio had his first major film role as Tobias "Toby" Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy Arnie Grape in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), becoming the seventh-youngest nominee in the category. He achieved international stardom in the epic romance Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film to that point. After a few commercially unsuccessful films, DiCaprio starred in two successful features in 2002: the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can and the historical drama Gangs of New York, which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.</p>
